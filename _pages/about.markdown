Hi, I am Gavin Eccles. Welcome to my site! I am 23 years old and live by the lovely velvet strand in Dublin. I am passionate about sports and technology. Currently, I work as a software developer for Optum.

## About this site
I’ve always wanted to create my own website, I just never found the time to make one. However, over the past few weeks, Covid-19 has caused major disruption and has led to an excess of time on my hands. I decided it was a good opportunity to start developing a website. A quick Google search for “Gavin Eccles” and you will find many people sharing my name. Gavin Eccles from Dublin does not show up....yet. The domain name www.gavineccles.com was still free and a few clicks later it was mine. I plan on using this website to blog about anything I find interesting or that could educate a wider audience. 

## Hobbies and interests
Sports have always played a big part in my life. The list is not limited to: football, gaelic football, swimming, tennis and running. One of my greatest passions in life is running whether it is laps around a muddy field (cross country) or 26 long miles on the road. I currently compete for Portmarnock AC and Trinity Harriers. My PBs are marathon: 2hr47m, 10K: 34:27, 5M: 27:00 and 5K: 16:10. However, there is way more to running than PBs, running is often the highlight of my day.

I love to travel and have been fortunate enough to travel to some amazing places. To date, I have visited 31 countries. Last summer I spent 4 months travelling Central to South America. In previous years I have visited places like Thailand, Mexico, Canada, United States and all over Europe. 

I enjoy spending time outdoors whether it be climbing an active volcano, Acatenango in Guatemala or simply walking my dog, Holly, a border Collie, on the beach.

I am passionate about learning new things whether it be reading books, keeping up to date with the latest technology or pursuing a new interest for photography.

## Educational Background
I graduated from Trinity College Dublin with a First Class Honours degree in Management Science and Information Systems Studies (MSISS).
The primary objective of the MSISS programme is to produce graduates who are both business and computer literate and who have a solid understanding of how to approach and solve practical problems using a variety of tools and techniques. The core modules included: Quantitative analysis, Information Systems, Business & Management.

Throughout my time in College and in the working world, I have built up an array of skills. Some of the programming languages I have learned include Python, Java, R and SQL. My main interest is in the data analytics and machine learning space. I have become accustomed to methods such as Neural Networks, Boosting and Random Forests. Find my (Kaggle account) here where I try to partake in the latest data science competitions. My final year project focused on applying machine learning methods to NBA datasets to predict player performances. In my spare time I try to upskill as much as I can like learning HTML and CSS to build this website.
