Hi, my name's gavin. This is a page for me to keep track of things.

Despite all this, I feel I need a place to organise my writing and showcase any other work I might do. I have written at [Medium](https://medium.com/@.aravindiyer) and also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aravindiyer/), and I intend to continue doing so. But I like my own little corner. Have fun reading, and if you find something you like, please [let me know](mailto:gavineccles17@gmail.com)! Cheers!
