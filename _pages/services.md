I plan on populating this page as time progresses with a range of service that I can provide. The current services I plan on pursuing are freelance web development and photography. 

## Web development
If you are interested in:
*	Establishing an online presence for a small business
*	Owning a personal website like this one where you can portray to the world what you’re all about
*	Having a blogging platform under your own domain
I would be able to help by doing all the developing and setup tasks for you. Please feel free to [contact me]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/) if you are interested. 

## Photography
In my spare time, I am teaching myself how to become a good photographer. I have ordered a couple of books and found some good tutorials online to do. In the future, I plan on using these skills to start a photography business. TBC…..
