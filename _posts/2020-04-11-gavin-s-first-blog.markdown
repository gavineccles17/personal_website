Delighted to have successfully made my first website under the domain - gavineccles.com.

{% include figure caption="Success!" image_path="success.jpg" alt="success" %}

I’ve always wanted to create my own website, I just never found the time to make one. However, over the past few weeks, Covid-19 has caused major disruption and has led to an excess of time on my hands. I thought I should do something productive with all this time on my hands and start developing a site. A quick Google search for “Gavin Eccles” results in many people sharing my name but Gavin from Dublin evident. However, the domain name www.gavineccles.com was free and a few clicks later it was mine. I plan on using this website to blog about anything I find interesting or that could educate a wider audience. 

Thank you!
