The corona virus pandemic has been a complete shock to the system. A lot of things that we once took for granted are no longer at our disposal like visiting grandparents, doing grocery shopping, commuting to work, watching sports on tv and socialising with friends. What started as a distant flu has overwhelmed and dramatically changed our day to day lives. I am writing this on the 3rd of May, 5 months since the virus appeared in Wuhan and 37 days since Leo Varadkar announced a shutdown in Ireland. At the beginning it seemed like everyone was relieved to have a siesta from commuting to the office but that feeling of content quickly vanished. Ireland has suffered hundreds of deaths, a troubled economy and a bored/frustrated nation. 

This is a difficult time for everyone especially those who have lost love ones but I encourage you to make the most of the extra time you have. The government released the long-term plans to return to a normal society and it seems like summer 2020 will be like none before. So how can you make the most of your time while locked away from friends, sports teams, colleagues and family? It requires a change in mindset to challenge yourself to do new things and use this time wisely.

I heard an interesting take on the isolation period for those who have been fortunate enough to still have employment…If you were offered 2 months of working at home before all this would you have taken it? I know I would have jumped at the opportunity to save 2hrs of commute time and to have an abundance of time for myself. The problem is we didn’t have “the choice”. It’s the ability to choose that gives us a feeling of empowerment. However, you still have a choice and that’s to get up each day and make the most of your free time. Being an introvert myself, I am quite enjoying the excess alone time but of course am missing socialising with friends and family but I find by having goals it helps me get by. Here’s some of the things I have been pursuing, hopefully you can take some inspiration from what I’ve been up to….

## Running

There has been a huge uptake in runners since the lockdown period. I have so many Facebook friends joining Strava for the first time and even that 5km challenge that went viral on Instagram. I think it’s great to see and I hope people will realise the benefits of running both for fitness and your mental health. If you are new to running, start small and set yourself small goals. You will notice your improvements week on week. I have set myself a target of running a PB in the 5km and this is keeping me focused and training hard. 

## Baking/Cooking

I was useless in the kitchen and still am. Having the ability to cook is so essential and at 23, its about time I started learning. I found a few happy pear recipe books lying around the house so decided to tick a few recipes off…To date, I have made a stir fry, Sheppard’s pie, curry, burritos, fajitas…and have baked marble cake, millionaire shortbreads, coffee cake, chocolate mousse cake, blueberry muffins and cookies to date. I have discovered that it is very satisfying to cook for others and to have extra food in the fridge for the next day. 

## Web development

I always wanted to create a website so used this opportunity to make this site...read more on my blog [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/_posts/2020-04-25-how-i-created-this-website-with-jekyll.markdown). Next, I’d like to learn more by going through tutorials online and become confident to make a website for someone. 

## Photography

I have always enjoyed photography, being amazed by Planet Earth documentaries or pictures on National Geographic. Yet, I have never pursued my interest. I saw Nikon were doing free courses for April so I watched some of those videos, went through some tutorials online and decided to buy my first camera. Just playing around with the settings now and started an Instagram account to document my progress. Here’s my new [insta account](https://www.instagram.com/gavin.eccles.photography/?hl=en).

## Books

I have never read enough books. I know I should but my attention spam is shocking. Sometimes even watching Netflix I can’t even focus on the TV without my phone in hand. I’d say I read an average of 2 books a year till 2020. I made it my new years resolution to read one a month. Since lockdown I have been flying through them for my standards and having purchased Amazon prime, ordered a stack of books I’ve always wanted to read. 

## Podcasts

Before the lockdown, I never brought my phone with me while running to listen to music/podcasts. I was quite narrow-minded that you shouldn’t need music to help you run. However, I decided to give it a try by purchasing a pair of AfterShokz and a Flipbelt. Damn I was wrong! It is such a great companion while doing slow runs, a great time to listen to educational podcasts/audio books. Have since been powering through them on my many hours of running and will be sticking with this approach into the future.

## Mindfulness

I have always been well aware of the benefits of Meditating yet I tell myself that I am too busy to find a few minutes to do it every day. I read somewhere that those who are too busy to meditate are those who need it the most. I have started doing 5 mins a day by just looking up videos and YouTube and the benefits are incredible. Your mind feels clear, you are less tense and more energized after each session.  

## Yoga

Yoga is a great compliment to a healthy body and to any runner. It’s just hard to find the time in a typical work week. In my additional time, I have tried to do my stretches for 5-10 minutes in the morning, after running and in the evening while watching tv. Your body will be so thankful if you do, you do not feel as sore the day after a workout.

## Strength & conditioning

S&C for me is gym work or any kind of abs, legs or upper body workouts. Being a runner, I disregard how important core and leg work are. I fell into a bad habit at the start of the lockdown and stopped doing my usual S&C and really noticed a lack of speed, increased soreness in my legs and stitch sensation in my stomach. This has been a weak point for me because it’s an effort to do and you don’t notice the immediate improvement on your running performance. However, I have started incorporating it three times a week just a small 30-minute session. This is the time to build up strength in your calf/ankle/quad/hamstring that always causing you discomfort. Use this time to work on that muscle group and you’ll come back stronger when events/matches resume later on.

## Reduce phone time

I hate looking at my phone. I get so overwhelmed with the constant bombardment of messages and notifications. I hate how obsessive everyone is on Instagram, showing only their best self. It’s really difficult for our mental health. I’d say before this pandemic I would spend 6 hours a day on my phone, now I’d say its 2-3 and I want to reduce it to 1. You will feel way less stresses if you do. Besides there’s not as much news to actually consume so most of the stuff on social media is garbage at the moment. 

## Happiness

I watched a brilliant series of lectures on Youtube called solve for happy and have since ordered the book. I would recommend anyone to [watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc24RCmvlTU). It’s not like the typical you only live once or everything happens for a reason happiness lecture. Mo Gawdat thought he had everything he wanted in life, more money than he needed but he still did not feel happy. It took a catastrophe for him to realise what he was missing and design a formula to help others achieve happiness. A long-term goal of mine is to strive for complete happiness and I’m using this time to use the techniques Mo spoke of.  

These are the things I have been up to and will be working on for the next while. I hope you will find the inspiration to do likewise. Why not start a new hobby or read that book you’ve always wanted to read or run your first 5km or teach yourself something you’ve always been curious about.  

In solve for happy, Mo uses the metaphor of a smartphone to describe modern life. At first, the battery on your smartphone is fantastic but then you download useless apps that begin to deteriorate your battery. Use this period to freshen up your apps, start deleting the ones that are causing you distress, download new ones that you’ve always wanted to and this will begin to replenish your battery life and you will come out of this stronger than ever!

Slán go fóill,

Gavin
